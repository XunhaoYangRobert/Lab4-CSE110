1.
	When we interact with the app, we are interacting with the Activity class. Within that, the method runOnUiThread is called and enqueues some work onto the main UI thread's message queue.

2.
	Blocking the main UI thread means to put too much work on the main thread. We want to avoid this because the UI depends on a functional main thread and when the main UI thread is blocked, it would be unresponsive. If this happens, simply no interaction can take place and we are stuck at one place, horrible user experience.
